# Readme

To install the Python code requirements for the respective chapters, I recommend creating a new virtual environment first:

```bash
conda create --new book python=3.9
conda activate book
```

I prefer `conda`, and for more step-by-step instructions please also see the [00-1_python-setup-guide](00-1_python-setup-guide) folder for my personal Python setup preferences.

However, you can also use any other virtual environment manager of your choice, for example, [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).



Then, you can ran the following pip command to install the code requirements:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
